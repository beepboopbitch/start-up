### Needs:
* _A straightforward layout that makes it easy to find info about the site_

### Pain Points:
* _Counter-intuitive site layout, overwhelming amount of pages, long boring descriptions_

### How we can serve:
* _Use short descriptions that make things very clear, only use pages we need, search bar to easily see all pages to look at_

# Research:
* _I had no idea what a co-working company was so I had to figure that out. Turns out it's just a place for people to get work done instead of at home with people that want the same kind of work environment as them_
