## A website build for a start up

**By Nayomi Morita**

# Description
* _A site designed for a diverse co-working environment_

# User Stories:

# _Bill_

### Needs:
* _An easy way to find details about subscription cost as well as a way to easily manage said subscription_

### Pain points:
* _Confusing subscription processes, vague descriptions_

### How we can serve:

# _Jane_

### Needs:
* _A straightforward layout that makes it easy to find info about the site_

### Pain Points:
* _Counter-intuitive site layout, overwhelming amount of pages, long boring descriptions_

### How we can serve:
* _Use short descriptions that make things very clear, only use pages we need, search bar to easily see all pages to look at_

# Research:
* _I had no idea what a co-working company was so I had to figure that out. Turns out it's just a place for people to get work done instead of at home with people that want the same kind of work environment as them_
